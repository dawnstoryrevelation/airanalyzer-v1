Welcome to the Idea Zone! Feel free to pitch in your ideas!

Jasper: What are your ideas? A possible idea is to create the website with a professional but dynamic look.
Eden: A Website that with an interactive globe that shows the current air quality of the area you click on.

**Collaborator Approval** - Unanimous Approval of Eden's Idea (Approved)

Jasper: I'm thinking there could be like two parts of the website. One could be stats of each country on the globe currently with the model's prediction of future stats,
AND a feature to take a picture of your current environment, and then the model calculates the air pollution levels of the area, based on your image. What do you think?

Vincent: predict what impact plant tree have on airpol level

Leon: maybe add statistics for how much air pollution comes from different sources such as cars, factories, etc and a list of every country's percentage of air pollution,
also showing a reasonable percentage for comparison

Leon: air pollution images https://unsplash.com/s/photos/air-pollution or https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/air-pollution

Jasper: We train two separate neural network models, one as a , and one as a 
PSS Ensemble. Then, we use an MAA to orchestrate predictions on the application. 

**Collaborator Approval** - Unanimous Approval of All Ideas So Far (Approved)

Jasper: How big should the model be in params? I think we shouldn't top anywhere more than 100 million params. I'm suggesting maybe around 30M?
Manageable with a T4 GPU or L4.
